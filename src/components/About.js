            Hi! My name is Will. Solving problems involving logic, abstraction and mathematics 
            is my passion - and theres nothing I love more than doing so through software that 
            provides value to end users or allows for insights into the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am most interested in full stack development. Although, I'd love to work 
            on either end of the stack. Aside from software, I'm interested in
            volunteering, excercise, and personal finance.
    </p>
    <p>     Thanks for checking out my site! </p>
