            Hi! My name is Will. I am a senior at UMASS Amherst pursuing a career in software 
            engineering. Building software is my passion - I love watching a project go 
            from the early stages of development into to a fine tuned, good looking and robust 
            application.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, and becuase I enjoy continual new learning experiances and challenges, 
            I am most interested in full stack development. Even so, I'd love to work 
            on either end of the stack. Aside from software, I'm also interested in excercise, 
            finance and entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <p>     Thanks for checking out my site!</p>
