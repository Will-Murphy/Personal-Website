            Hi! My name is Will. I am a senior at UMASS Amherst pursuing a career in software 
            engineering. Solving problems involving logic, abstraction and mathematics is my passion - 
            and theres nothing I love more than doing so through software that provides value 
            to end users or allows for insights into the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, and becuase I enjoy continual new learning experiances and challenges, 
            I am most interested in full stack development. Although, I'd love to work 
            on either end of the stack. Aside from software, I'm also interested in
            finance and entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <p>     Thanks for checking out my site!</p>
